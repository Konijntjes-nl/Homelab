# Ansible Ideas

This folder contains conceptual notes, project ideas, and potential playbook outlines exploring how to leverage Ansible automation within a Homelab environment, particularly integrating with CyberArk and Proxmox.

---

## Purpose

The goal is to document and brainstorm ways to automate common and advanced tasks using Ansible to manage infrastructure, security, and virtual machines efficiently.

---

## CyberArk Integration Ideas

- **Automate Privileged Account Management**  
  Use Ansible to interact with CyberArkâ€™s REST API to manage privileged accounts, enforce compliance, rotate passwords, and report on access logs.

- **Credential Injection for Playbooks**  
  Retrieve secrets dynamically from CyberArk Vault to inject into playbooks at runtime, avoiding hardcoded passwords and enhancing security.

- **Automated CPM Resumption and Password Resets**  
  Create playbooks that detect non-compliant accounts and automatically trigger CyberArk CPM actions to fix issues.

- **Session Monitoring and Logging**  
  Schedule playbooks to collect and archive CyberArk PSM session logs for audit and compliance purposes.

---

## Proxmox Automation Ideas

- **VM Template Creation and Management**  
  Automate the provisioning, customization, and deployment of VM templates (e.g., Rocky Linux, Ubuntu) on Proxmox hosts using Ansible modules or shell scripts.

- **Cluster Health Checks and Reporting**  
  Use Ansible to gather cluster and node health information, generate reports, and alert on anomalies.

- **Backup and Restore Automation**  
  Implement playbooks to schedule, verify, and manage VM backups using Proxmox APIs or CLI tools.

- **Dynamic Inventory of VMs**  
  Create dynamic inventory scripts that pull VM details directly from Proxmox, enabling targeted playbook runs.

---

## Homelab-Wide Automation Concepts

- **Unified Configuration Management**  
  Centralize configuration across CyberArk, Proxmox, and other homelab components with Ansible for consistency and repeatability.

- **Security Compliance Enforcement**  
  Use Ansible to apply security baselines and check compliance status across all systems and accounts.

- **Monitoring and Alerting Playbooks**  
  Deploy playbooks that configure monitoring agents and alerting rules for proactive system management.

- **User and Access Management**  
  Automate the onboarding and offboarding of users across CyberArk and Proxmox with integrated playbooks.
