CyberArk Monitoring Architecture and Dashboard Design (PowerShell Enabled)

🎯 Goals

Ensure high availability of CyberArk components

Enable proactive alerting and diagnostics

Provide a centralized view of system health and usage

Facilitate compliance and audit reporting

🏗️ Monitoring Architecture Overview

1. Core Components to Monitor

Vault (PrivateArk Server)

Password Vault Web Access (PVWA)

Central Policy Manager (CPM)

Privileged Session Manager (PSM)

Privileged Threat Analytics (PTA)

Credential Provider / CCP (AIM)

2. Data Collection Methods

PowerShell Scripts (API polling for PVWA, LiveSessions, Audit, Health)

Windows Services Monitoring

Event Logs & Syslog

File System Monitoring (Logs, backups)

SNMP (optional)

3. Monitoring Tools

PowerShell monitoring scripts (included)

SIEM Integration (e.g., Splunk, QRadar, ELK)

Windows Performance Monitor / Task Scheduler

Grafana Dashboards (via JSON exports or InfluxDB)

Email/Slack Alerting from PowerShell

4. Alerting Triggers

Service unavailability (via Get-Service)

API or login failure (handled via try/catch)

Failed password change attempts

Session anomalies (via session counts/stats)

Disk space threshold breach (Get-PSDrive)

Backup failure detection

📊 Monitoring Dashboard Design (Grafana/Splunk/Kibana)

Alert annotations

🛠️ Deployment Blueprint

Infrastructure:

Monitoring Node (Windows VM with PowerShell)

Schedule collector scripts via Task Scheduler

Output JSON logs for Grafana or forward via Filebeat

Use InfluxDB for time-series metrics if needed

PowerShell Script Bundle:

Check-VaultStatus.ps1

Monitor-CyberArkAPI.ps1

Monitor-CyberArkSessions.ps1

Send-EmailAlert.ps1

Export-CyberArkMetrics.ps1

Security:

Secure API credentials using Windows Credential Manager

HTTPS communication with API endpoints

Role-based access to output dashboards/logs

✅ Summary

With this PowerShell-integrated monitoring architecture, CyberArk administrators gain real-time visibility into the health and security posture of their PAM ecosystem. Coupled with alerts and rich dashboards, this helps reduce MTTR, identify trends, and ensure continuous compliance.
